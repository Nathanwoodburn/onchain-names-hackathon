# Why Onchain names and Identity ?

## What is onchain ?

On-chain transactions are transactions that occur on a blockchain that are reflected on the distributed, public ledger. On-chain transactions are those that have been validated or authenticated and lead to an update to the overall blockchain network.

### Benefits of on-chain identity for users are:

- Total, censor-proof control over their identities.
- Portability. Individuals will be able to carry their identities with themselves and bring them to various platforms through cyberspace.
- Security. Decentralized identity is enabled by decentralized identifiers, a type of unique identifiers which is protected by a private key. The key being known only to the identity owner makes hacking very hard if not impossible.
- Convenience. Having only one digital identity will make it easy for individuals to use different chains and wallets. It will lead to better user experience and will hopefully enable a wider adoption of blockchain technology.

*Gartner Hype Cycles explain the stage of innovative or new technologies, both in maturity as well as the speed of moving forward: how long it will take for a technology to reach the so-called "plateau of productivity".*
Interesting upcoming technologies in the Hype Cycle are identity wallets and zero-knowledge proofs. Decentralised identities and verifiable claims are beyond the peak of the hype cycle, with obstacles such as the lack of viable eco-systems.

There are many protocols building the future of on-chain identity. It is a broad field, and many builders work on different problems. There are protocols which aggregate multiple profiles of users across separate platforms. Then, there are social media platforms which take users’ addresses as their identities. Some are working on developing an on-chain reputation system.
These protocols enable social media to be permissionless and open. We are used to the idea of social media being controlled by several big players which own users’ data. This makes it restricted for us to choose the type of content we’d like to see on our feed. On-chain identity social protocols will change this.

Though not known even to most experienced crypto users, on-chain identity is one of the most important and least understood issues. The issue matters because it gives the individual the censor-proof control over his / her identity.

Furthermore, digital identity is a) portable in that the user can bring his identity to different platforms and blockchains, and b) convenient in that possessing only one on-chain identity will make it easy to use different wallets and platforms. The main benefit of it, in my opinion, is security that digital identity provides. Since it is secured by a private key, hacking on-chain identity is nearly impossible unless the individual himself reveals their personal information.

And the most effective digital identity, it should take the form of a domain.

A domain name may be the most useful type of pseudonym
f(“Your name”) <
f(“yourname.eth”) =
f(“yourpseudonym.eth”)
