# Nostr

## Objective:

Participants are tasked with developing a Nostr client capable of resolving Handshake $HNS in addition to traditional ICANN domain names. The system must prioritize security, efficiency, and seamless integration with both domain systems.

## Requirements:

- Handshake $HNS Integration:
  - The Nostr client must resolve Handshake $HNS ensuring compatibility with HIP05 (crosschain) domains in addition top standard Handshake domains.

- Security and Efficiency:
  - Implement efficient resolution mechanisms to ensure timely and accurate resolution of domains.
  - Incorporate security measures to protect against malicious attacks and ensure the integrity of domain resolution.

- Self-Hostable:
  - Design the Nostr client to be self-hostable, allowing users to deploy and manage their domain resolution independently. Provide detailed documentation for setting up the Nostr client.

- Comprehensive Setup Instructions:
  - Detailed documentation is required for setting up the Nostr client. Instructions should be clear, concise, and encompass all necessary steps for successful implementation.

## Deliverables:

- Nostr Client Implementation (100% of bounty):
  - Develop a Nostr client that efficiently resolves both Handshake $HNS and ICANN domains.
  - Ensure the client is secure and robust, protecting against malicious attacks and ensuring reliable resolution for both types of domains.
  - Documentation should include a step-by-step guide for setting up the Nostr client, including all necessary dependencies and configurations.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Adherence to task requirements and specifications.
- Security and efficiency of the implemented solution for both $HNS and ICANN domains.
- Clarity and completeness of setup instructions.
- Overall creativity, innovation, and usability of the Nostr client.
