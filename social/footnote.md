# Footnote Protocol Enhancement: Usability and Interoperability

[Footnote](https://github.com/kyokan/footnote) is an experimental Handshake layer two protocol for storing, synchronizing, and addressing small amounts of data. Its purpose is to create a global, decentralized, and permissionless data commons that allows everyone to store and retrieve data from any node on the Footnote network.

## Objectives:

1. **Usability Enhancement**:
   - Develop a JavaScript implementation of [PIP-001 to PIP-005](https://github.com/kyokan/footnote-PIPs) of the Footnote protocol.

2. **Interoperability**:
   - Integrate Footnote with other naming systems such as ENS and ICANN using [PIP-003](https://github.com/kyokan/footnote-PIPs).
   - Ensure seamless data sharing and retrieval across different naming systems for enhanced interoperability.

## Deliverables:

- **Usability Enhancement**:
  - Develop a JavaScript implementation of PIP-001 to PIP-005 to improve usability.
  - Provide documentation on how to use the JavaScript implementation to interact with Footnote.

- **Interoperability**:
  - Implement integration with other naming systems such as ENS and ICANN based on PIP-003.
  - Document the integration process and provide examples of data sharing and retrieval across different naming systems.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Adherence to Footnote protocol specifications and PIPs.
- Usability improvements demonstrated through the JavaScript implementation.
- Interoperability achievements with other naming systems such as ENS and ICANN.
- Documentation quality and clarity.
