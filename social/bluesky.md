# BlueSky

## Objective:

BlueSky is a project to create a decentralized, open-source, and secure social media protocol. [Find out here](https://bsky.social/about/)  
BlueSky uses the at protocol to connect users to other social users and servers. 

Participants are tasked with developing a Bluesky client capable of resolving Handshake $HNS. The system must prioritize security, privacy, and efficiency, providing a seamless and decentralized approach to domain resolution.

## Requirements:

- Handshake $HNS and ICANN Domain Integration:
  - The Bluesky client must resolve both Handshake $HNS and traditional ICANN domain names, ensuring compatibility and support across different domain systems.

- Security and Privacy:
  - Implement secure and private resolution mechanisms to protect user data and ensure the confidentiality of domain resolution requests.
  - Incorporate encryption and other security measures to protect against malicious attacks and ensure the integrity of domain resolution for both $HNS and ICANN domains.

- Decentralized Approach:
  - Design the Bluesky client to be decentralized, utilizing a peer-to-peer network for domain resolution. This approach should enhance security, privacy, and reliability.

- Comprehensive Setup Instructions:
  - Detailed documentation is required for setting up the Bluesky client. Instructions should be clear, concise, and encompass all necessary steps for successful implementation.

## Deliverables:

- Bluesky Client Implementation:
  - Develop a Bluesky client that efficiently resolves both Handshake $HNS and ICANN domains.
  - Ensure the client prioritizes security, privacy, and decentralization, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for domain resolution.
  - Documentation should include a step-by-step guide for setting up the Bluesky client, including all necessary dependencies and configurations.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Adherence to task requirements and specifications.
- Security, privacy, and decentralization of the implemented solution for both $HNS and ICANN domains.
- Clarity and completeness of setup instructions.
- Overall creativity, innovation, and usability of the Bluesky client.
