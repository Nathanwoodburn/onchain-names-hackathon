# Fediverse

## Objective:

Participants are tasked with developing a Fediverse (Federation of social network servers) app tailored to Handshake $HNS domain names. The app must prioritize user privacy, data ownership, and interoperability with existing Fediverse platforms.

For example, Nextcloud lets users send files to username@nextclouddomain.com ([See here](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/files/sharing.html#creating-a-new-federation-share)). This project could allow users to send files to username@handshakedomain.
Another example would be mastodon, where users could follow username@handshakedomain.


## Requirements:

- Exclusive Handshake $HNS Domain Integration:
  - The Fediverse app must interact with Handshake $HNS domain names, ensuring compatibility and support within the Handshake ecosystem.

- User Privacy and Data Ownership:
  - Implement features that prioritize user privacy and data ownership, allowing users to have control over their data and interactions within the app.

- Interoperability with Fediverse Platforms:
  - Ensure the app is interoperable with existing Fediverse platforms, allowing users to connect and interact with users from other Fediverse instances seamlessly.

- Self-Hostable:
  - Design the Fediverse app to be self-hostable, allowing users to deploy and manage their instance independently. Provide detailed documentation for setting up the Fediverse app.

- Comprehensive Setup Instructions:
  - Detailed documentation is required for setting up the Fediverse app. Instructions should be clear, concise, and encompass all necessary steps for successful implementation.

## Deliverables:

- Fediverse App Implementation:
  - Develop a Fediverse app that prioritizes user privacy, data ownership, and interoperability with existing Fediverse platforms.
  - Ensure the app interacts with Handshake $HNS domain names and integrates seamlessly within the Handshake ecosystem.
  - Allows users to send messages, files, or other data using their Handshake domain as their username.
  - Documentation should include a step-by-step guide for setting up the Fediverse app, including all necessary dependencies and configurations.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Adherence to task requirements and specifications.
- User privacy, data ownership, and interoperability of the implemented solution.
- Clarity and completeness of setup instructions.
- Overall creativity, innovation, and usability of the Fediverse app.
