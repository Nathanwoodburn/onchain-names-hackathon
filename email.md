# Hackathon Task: Building a Secure Email System for Handshake $HNS Domains

## Objective:

Participants are tasked with developing an email server and client
exclusively tailored to Handshake $HNS domain names. The
system must prioritize security and privacy, featuring E2E
encryption for all communications. Additionally, participants must
ensure the solution is self-hostable, providing detailed setup
instructions for both server and client configurations.


## Requirements:

- Exclusive Handshake $HNS Domain Integration:
  - Both the email server and client must exclusively interact
with Handshake $HNS domain names, ensuring
compatibility and support within the Handshake
ecosystem.

- E2E Encryption for Email Client:
  - The email client should integrate E2E encryption to
secure email communications, safeguarding the privacy
and confidentiality of messages exchanged.

- Self-Hostable Email Server:
  - Participants must design the email server to be selfhostable, allowing users to deploy and manage their
email infrastructure independently. Detailed
documentation is required for setting up the email server.

- Comprehensive Setup Instructions:
  - Detailed documentation is required for setting up both the
email server and client. Instructions should be clear,
concise, and encompass all necessary steps for
successful implementation.
Deliverables:

- Email Server Setup:
  - Use an open-source email server solution like [Modoboa](https://github.com/modoboa/modoboa) to establish a
secure email server environment.
  - Configure the server to interact solely with Handshak $HNS domains, ensuring seamless integration within the Handshake ecosystem.
  - Utilize [HNSD](https://github.com/handshake-org/hnsd) for
DNS resolution.

- Email Client Configuration:
  - Use an open-source, end-to-end encrypted email client
like [Tuta](https://github.com/tutao/tutanota) or similar.
  - Configure the email client to exclusively communicate
with Handshake $HNS domains.

- Documentation:
  - Provide clear and concise documentation detailing the
setup process for both the email server and client
configurations.


## Evaluation Criteria:

- Adherence to task requirements and specifications.
- Security and robustness of the implemented solutions.
- Clarity and completeness of setup instructions.
- Overall creativity, innovation, and usability of the email system.
