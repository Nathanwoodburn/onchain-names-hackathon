## Description

Create or modify a Fediverse app to allow users to link/share/talk to users via Handshake names.

For example, Nextcloud lets users send files to username@nextclouddomain.com ([See here](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/en/files/sharing.html#creating-a-new-federation-share)). This project could allow users to send files to username@handshakedomain.
Another example would be mastodon, where users could follow username@handshakedomain.

## Requirements

- Allow user to receive and send messages, files or other data using their Handshake domain as their username.
